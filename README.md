# 1. X-Ray Images Pneumonia Detection
In this project I have created a model, which uses a CNN architecture for classifying images as having pneumonia or not.
The model achieved 83% accuracy on the test dataset. To prevent overfitting I have used layers like:
### i. DropOut
### ii. Batch Normalization.
### To solve the problem of imbalanced datasets, I have used the ImageDataGenerator class of the Keras Library.
